django-scribbler
===================

django-scribbler is an application for managing snippets of text for a Django website.
Similar projects include django-flatblocks, django-chunks and django-pagelets. This
project attempts to take some of the best concepts from those previous projects as
well as focus on giving the users instant feedback inspired by Bret Victor's
`Inventing on Principle <http://vimeo.com/36579366>`_ talk.
